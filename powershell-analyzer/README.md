## Run in Action

## Example usage

Minimal uses expression to use this action:

``` yaml
- uses: ./powershell-analyzer
  name: Lint PowerShell Scripts
  id: powershell-analyzer
```

Example for calling this action from a different repository:

```yml
- uses: Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-Actions/powershell-analyzer@latest
  name: Lint PowerShell Scripts
  id: powershell-analyzer
```

‚ùó In this one case, it is appropriate to use a tag ("latest") instead of a
commit hash. Otherwise we have a chicken-and-egg problem: the approved list of
actions would need to know the has for the commit that saves the update to the
action.

## Full example

This example shows how to use the action to get a json file with all the used
actions in an organization. The json file is uploaded as an artefact in the
third step.

``` yaml
jobs:
  load-all-used-actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-Actions/powershell-analyzer@latest
        name: Lint PowerShell Scripts
        id: powershell-analyzer
```

## Outputs
